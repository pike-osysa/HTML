    <h2>OUR PROGRAMS</h2>
    <div class="program-box">
    <h3>Fullstack web development</h3>
    <P>Full-stack web development involves building both the front end (what users see) and the back end (how everything works behind the scenes) of a website or web application. A full-stack developer works with various technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, and uses languages like Python, Node.js, or PHP along with databases such as MySQL or MongoDB for the back end. This role requires a broad skill set, allowing developers to create fully functional, responsive, and dynamic web experiences from start to finish. Full-stack development is essential for modern web solutions, offering flexibility and complete control over the project.</P>
